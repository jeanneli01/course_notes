# Course Notes
## Keep in mind when coding:
- write code for humans not computers
- write data for computers not humans
- code using relative path for collaborations

## Terminal vs Shell:
- terminal shows the results of shell
- many types of shells exists; we use the Bash shell

## Handy Tips:
- /Users goes back to the root of the computer
- use tab completion

## Naming Files and More:
- avoid using spaces
- instead of spaces, use: - dash or _ underscore
- or choose to capitalize every first letter
- don't name variables using spaces either
- to learn more, refer to Jenny Brians' presentation on file naming
